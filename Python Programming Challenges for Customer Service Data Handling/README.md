2. Python Programming Challenges for Customer Service Data Handling

The program associated with this task is run through Main.py, housed in the "Task 1" folder.

Main.py works with "newService.py", "ticketDisplay.py", "ticketStatuscahnge.py", and "exitStrategy.py" to take the users information and issue, then organize the service tickets that can be marked complete once handled. Currently any user can mark completion and view service tickets by compeletion status.

Main.py is the "Main Menu" to the program.

In Main.py the user can choose to:
    1. Create a new ticket.
    2. Display Current tickets.
    3. Change the completion status.
    4. Exit the program


When creating a new ticket be sure to keep your issue as concise as possible.
Displaying tickets will display the current tickets in the system based on submission order.
Changing the completion status is just that. If you are unsure what the ticket number was, you can choose the second menu option to display the tickets again so you can find the appropriate ticket to mark compelte.
Exiting the program does just that.

Happy service ticket writing!
